This project is an internal application built using the Next.js framework.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
* **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* **Database**: SQLite with [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
* **Authentication**: Custom JWT-less auth with bcrypt password hashing
* **Linting**: ESLint

## Current Features

1. **Authentication & User Registration (Database Backed)**:
   * **Database**: Uses SQLite with Prisma ORM for simplified deployment.
   *   **Login Page (`/login`)**:
       *   Users log in using their First Name, Last Name, and numeric Password (6-8 digits). Login logic performs a case-insensitive name check.
     * Features an optimized space-efficient design.
     * Includes a link to the onboarding page for new users.
     * Input validation via Zod on the backend.
     * On successful login, users are redirected to `/dashboard`.
     * Redirects logged-in users away from this page.
     * Provides clear guidance for users who just completed onboarding.
   * **Onboarding & Registration (`/onboarding`)**:
     * Accessed via `/onboarding?role=...`.
     *   Collects First Name, Last Name, and Password (validated for 6-8 numeric digits).
     * Requires agreement to all policies and completion of tool checklist.
     * Prevents duplicate user registration by checking both name and ID number.
     * On completion, calls `/api/auth/register` to save user data (with hashed ID number) to the database.
     * Triggers a welcome animation upon successful registration.
   * **API Routes**:
     * `POST /api/auth/register`: Handles user creation, password hashing (bcryptjs), and database storage via Prisma. Validates input using Zod. Includes duplicate user prevention.
     * `POST /api/auth/login`: Handles user lookup (case-insensitive name), password verification (bcryptjs), returns user data upon success, and records login attempts. Validates input using Zod.
   * **API Routes (Admin)**:
     * `GET, POST /api/admin/announcements`: For managing announcements.
     * `GET, PUT, DELETE /api/admin/announcements/[id]`: For specific announcement operations.
     * `GET /api/admin/login-attempts`: For fetching login attempt logs.
     * `GET, POST /api/admin/maintenance`: For managing IT maintenance events.
     * `GET, PUT, DELETE /api/admin/maintenance/[eventId]`: For specific maintenance event operations.
   * **Authentication Context (`AuthContext`)**:
     * Manages active user session state (login status, user details fetched from API).
     * Calls login/register API endpoints.
     * Provides logout functionality.
     * Persists active session state in `localStorage` for browser session continuity.
     * Improved error handling with specific error messages.

2. **Onboarding Page (`/onboarding`)**:

   * Includes introductory text and a link to the helpdesk.
   * Shows an overall progress bar tracking completion of all policies and tools.
   * Presents IT information structured into 6 modules (5 policy modules, 1 tool checklist module).
   * Each module displays its title (e.g., "ðŸš€ Module 1 of 6: Getting Set Up") and its own progress indicator.
   * Policy items within modules are displayed with relevant icons (`lucide-react`).
   * Each policy requires explicit acknowledgement via an "I Understand and Agree" button.
   * Module 6 contains the role-specific tool setup checklist using checkboxes.
   * Input fields for First Name, Last Name, and ID Number are provided for registration.
   * The "Finish Onboarding & Proceed" button is enabled only after all policies are agreed, all tools are checked, and user details are provided.
   * Includes a footer with a welcome message and helpdesk link.
   * Modern UI with subtle animations and visual feedback.

3. **Welcome Animation**:
   * Triggered after successfully completing onboarding and registration.

       * **Maintenance Calendar**: Dedicated section for admins to create, edit, view, and delete scheduled IT maintenance events (e.g., Preventive Maintenance, System Updates). (*Note: Date picker interaction in the create/edit form is currently under review.*)

7. **IT Calendar Page (`/it-calendar`)**:
   * Dynamically displays upcoming and past IT maintenance events fetched from the database.
   * Categorizes events by type with distinct icons.
   * Replaces previous hardcoded maintenance schedule logic.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd io-portal
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Setup Database**: The project uses SQLite by default, which requires minimal setup. Ensure your `.env` file contains:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   ```
4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
5. **Create an Admin User** (Optional):
   ```bash
   node create-admin.js
   ```
6. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser. You will be redirected to `/login`. New users should click the link to go to `/onboarding?role=employee` first.

* **Code Refactoring & Optimization (May 21, Evening)**:
    *   **Onboarding Page**: Refactored by extracting helper functions ([`getIconForPolicyItem`](io-portal/src/lib/onboardingUtils.tsx:1), [`renderMarkdownContent`](io-portal/src/lib/onboardingUtils.tsx:1)) to [`src/lib/onboardingUtils.tsx`](io-portal/src/lib/onboardingUtils.tsx:1) and the Welcome Animation to [`src/components/features/WelcomeAnimation.tsx`](io-portal/src/components/features/WelcomeAnimation.tsx:1). Reduced file length significantly.
    *   **Admin Dashboard**: Refactored by extracting the "Announcements" section to [`src/components/admin/AnnouncementsSection.tsx`](io-portal/src/components/admin/AnnouncementsSection.tsx:1) and the "Login Attempts" section to [`src/components/admin/LoginAttemptsSection.tsx`](io-portal/src/components/admin/LoginAttemptsSection.tsx:1). Further refactored to use a tabbed layout.
    *   **Auth Context**: Optimized `agreePolicy` and `checkTool` functions for simplicity.
    *   Reviewed and ensured other key components and API routes are within reasonable complexity and length.
